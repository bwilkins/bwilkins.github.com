        <title>Wouldn&#39;t It Be Awesome If...</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;aka-research-development-and-scope-creep&quot;&gt;a.k.a Research, Development and Scope-Creep&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 in a series of posts about a little electronics project I started at work. &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/i-couldnt-do-that-could-i.html&quot;&gt;You can find the first post here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said in my previous post, I wanted to build a device to show financial goals or the company’s financial milestones. I wanted this to be visible from across the room, so it had to be big… what could I use that would fit the bill?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/split_flap_display.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Split Flap Display&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen those large old boards at some airports or other travel ports that make a whole lot of clacking noise? You know, the ones that physically turn over a set of cards until it gets to the right number? Those would be sweet as to get running and have some numbers displayed on… If only they weren’t about $100 apiece for a single module! Also thinking about it now, that noise would have been SOOO obnoxious. Split-Flaps: Scratched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/alarm_clock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Digital Alarm Clock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my mind went to alarm clocks - digital alarm clocks specifically. I personally think that the seven-segment displays on alarm clocks give numbers a much more tactility than just being put up on a monitor, and they’re relatively easy to find, so let’s follow this path some more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaycar, a massive hobbyist/electronics chain here in Australia and NZ, stocks these displays in a few different sizes. I wanted this display to be seen from across the office, so naturally this meant big - how big can you get? Having a nosey around the Melbourne CBD Jaycar store, I grabbed a couple of 2.3” large displays, and a couple of driver ICs for them, all for the purposes of testing and determining if they were going to be the right tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent almost a full day trying to figure out the pin-out of the displays I bought! It didn’t help that I was trying to use a 5V source, and after a bit of… “study” (RTFM/RTF Datasheet) I discovered that each of the main elements had 4 LEDs in series to light it up. In a bit of a hail-mary effort to try and get this thing to light up I pulled out a 9V battery and started feeding that in and once I found ground, hey presto, it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/it_works.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;It&#39;s working!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, each of the main elements (segments) of the display used 4 LEDs in series (2 for the decimal point). Each of these LEDs was contributing a 1.8V voltage drop, summing up in series to 7.2V, which explains the failure of the 5V source to light anything up! During this period of discovery I think I also burnt out the dot on one of the displays, but that’s ok, it was all in the name of research!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to mention at this point that the “driver” IC is actually what’s called a “BCD decoder,” or “Binary-Coded Decimal decoder.” It takes 4 inputs A, B, C and D, each coresponding to the numbers 1, 2, 4 and 8. With any combination of these numbers you can make any decimal number, which the decoder decodes and sends out through it’s 7 outputs, which earch correspond to a segment on the seven-segment display. Some BCD decoders have slightly different input schemes, such as A=1, B=2, C=2 and D=4, which prevents you from giving it input that it can’t display. The decoders I have just blank out the display when the number if is given doesn’t fit within the range of 0-9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea seemed to have some legs, so I thought I’d move ahead with this and see how it plays out. I ignored all the problems that were surfacing in my head, such as power consumption, how I’d power it, how I’d control it, etc. Those were problems for another day!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Couldn&#39;t Do That! ...Could I?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It all started with a meeting about our goals in the office, and how our performance for the year was to be measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a Software Developer on the delivery team at Hooroo, aka Qantas Hotels and Jetstar Hotels. While being a seperate company, we utilise the HR of Jetstar, and thus have some of their overhead in the company, which includes these KPIs and other stuff that generally nobody likes, but everybody lives with. If there’s a story there, it’s for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in my particular team at Hooroo we were having this meeting about how the specific technical KPIs applied to us. We have some about Technical Competency, Continuous Improvement and so on, but we also have this strange one, “Engaging with Financial Goals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean to engage with financial goals? I don’t know either! So I thought I’d start with just getting something financially related displaying… somewhere, y’know, visible. Somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about some people, but if I don’t see something in a non-intrusive way every day, I find it hard to interact with, or remember to look for it. Emails, for instance, can be quite intrusive, if not just noisy. We totally get the relevant financial figures coming into our email inboxes on a day to day basis - along with lots of other things. Noise, alert fatigue, whatever - this has all been filtered out of my inbox so I can see what I think is really important, which are usually one-off, non-repeating comms with other humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a couple of monitors up on the walls, showing a couple of different sets of information - we’ve got the status of our application builds, the total number of visitors currently on our main website, and a map display of where high-value bookings have been made. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hooroo.github.io/blog/2015/03/31/arduino-build-light/&quot;&gt;We’ve also got what we call a “Build Light”&lt;/a&gt;, which is an aggregate view of the status of all of our builds. I had something to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally though, I think the monitors are boring, perhaps a little too easy to get information up on. Build Lights, on the other hand, that’s pretty cool! How can I apply the build-light hardware foo to showing financial goals? Wouldn’t it be awesome to build a low-tech, multi-digit display to show our financial goals or current performance on? Perhaps using something like the kind of digits you used to see on your alarm clock, back when it was still a box that sat on your bedside table, before it was your phone…? But I couldn’t do that… Could I?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cambodia Trip - Day 1</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get dressed, pack the last few items and out the door. Ready to go by… 6:15?! I wouldn’t say that we were ready to go, we had enjoyed Vietnam so much, but we were packed, on our feet, and standing outside the hotel we’d rather recently checked out of. The restaurant wasn’t even open by this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a drastic change to the flow of events so far, started the day by loading our heavy luggage onto cyclos, then proceeded to walk a few blocks. We walked to a local park area, where we passed people playing games, dancing, crimping… Anything for a bit of exercise. It was here that we identified our bags once again, had them tagged, then boarded a public bus - the Mekong Express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new tour guide, Sum (pronounced with the vowel sound of oomph or umph) said there was method to this 6:15am madness. Along the way to Phnom Penh we needed to cross the Mekong Delta, and the only way to do this currently was by ferry. In his experience, the ferry always seems to get stuck partway, probably due to the busyness of the area. He didn’t want for us to be roasting in the afternoon heat while we waited to get back to land. But more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was two hours before we reached the country border. During this time we filled out forms and were treated to a variety of western and Cambodian pop music. Thankfully we were given a small packed breakfast from the hotel, and received a small snack on the bus, so we weren’t starving the whole way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The border was very busy. If you think emigration/immigration at the airport sucks, you probably don’t want to go through a land crossing. The bus company made the process a bit easier, taking all the passports from the bus occupants to the counter at once, so we just had to wait until our names were called. We had gotten of the bus and entered a building to do this crossing. Once through, however, we were only half done. What we’d just been through was exiting Vietnam. We were now on international soil, and had yet to enter Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with Cambodian visas, the next part was relatively straightforward. We all got back into the bus and drove over to the Cambodian border entry building. Those with visas could go straight through to the immigration desks and get their entry stamps. For those of us without our visas, we had given our passports back to the assistant from the bus, who went to a small building outside where the visas could be bought from. Our Vietnamese visas, which we sent our passports away for before our trip, cost about $95 (AUD) each. Comparatively, Cambodian visas at the border cost $25 (USD) each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about everything in Cambodia is compared with Vietnam, in my head. The roads (and traffic) are no exception. Roads in Cambodia… Have been found wanting. They are not as wide, occasionally they are just dirt, and with more cars and less motorbikes, there’s generally just less room. The countryside, however, is still beautiful. Since it’s tropical, you’ll find more “New Zealand green” than “Australian green”, much the same as Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were still about 5 hours away from Phnom Penh, and it took about 1 or 2 hours to get to the aforementioned ferry. Luckily, we only had about ten minutes stand still, and soon we were back on land. But not before seeing the sheer number of people heading in the other direction, many in motorbikes, and all unbelievably packed into the ferry going the other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About five minutes later we’d stopped again, this time to have lunch. We’d stopped outside a small collection of food stalls, all under one roof. You would be mistaken to think it was just one big cafe. Spoilt for choice, I went for rice noodles with chicken curry. For $2. I also discovered the flexibility of currency here - I actually paid one US dollar and 20,000 Vietnamese dong. Over the moon at the price, I was just as happy with the flavours - Cambodia uses a lot more spice (note: not necessarily spicy) and the flavour palette just woke up my tongue. In Vietnam, at lot of food was oily and less strong in flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phnom Penh is a strange mixture of old and new. Many of the buildings are rather squat, with a few skyscrapers dotted around. We dropped our bags off at the hotel and went for a short tuktuk tour around the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited the hill and the statue of the woman the city was named after, though we didn’t go inside the temple on the hill. I was getting rather hungry by this time.  We went onwards, catching the tuktuks to the next destination, a famed roundabout. In the middle of this roundabout was a tower, erected after the reigning king of the time drove the French out of the country. Nearby was a statue of the king, facing east in the traditional Buddhist fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking along the river we soon reached our destination for dinner, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yourphnompenh.com/river-crown/&quot;&gt;River Crown Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. The menu was mostly western, which was disappointing. But it was happy hour, so I ordered a pint and a pizza. Besides, Phnom Penh was apparently not the place to get good Cambodian food made properly. Still, I probably didn’t need the whole pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long day, there was no bandying about considering going to the hotel bar. Straight to bed, and an early night for Brett.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vietnam Trip - Day 15</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-15&quot;&gt;Day 15&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was another early day, and after another breakfast we got into our bus and left the hotel for a day out on the Mekong Delta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we weren’t going to visit the floating villages/markets, but it was still a good experience nonetheless. We were going to visit a couple of islands before heading over to tour the Ben Tre province. On one island we learned how coconuts are harvested and all different parts are used. Most prominent was the manufacturing of coconut candy, while there were also carvings,  and some coconut husks were used for burning to cook the coconut candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While on this island I also got to have my first experience holding a snake. This one was rather large but wasn’t poisonous, instead it was a constrictor. I didn’t get any of my own photos of this, but one of the others got one of me with the snake,  so hopefully later on after the trip I’ll be able to post proof!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another island we visited we got to visit was more for trying various tropical fruit. These were mostly your standard watermelon, pineapple and mango, we also had fresh jackfruit and a special red dragonfruit (normally, dragonfruit has white flesh). We were also treated to some traditional Vietnamese music and singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we left for another, larger island in the Ben Tre province. We took small row boats up a small river,  surrounded by water coconuts and other flora. After about  15 minutes we disembarked, and it was time for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was a five course meal, starting with fried fish in fresh spring rolls, moving through steamed prawns, pork pancakes and some deliciously seasoned chicken. As per usual, the final course was a fresh fruit dessert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had enough time before leaving for a bit of rest, and we were surround by hammocks. Some of us rested for a short while in the hammocks until it was time to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was to be my first tuktuk experience. These tuktuks had an open roof, so we got on the back and put helmets on. Occasionally,  we would duck to avoid low hanging branches. They took us for a tour through Ben Tre Province, ending at a harbour where our original boat was waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed back to the mainland, and loaded back into the bus. It was a couple of hours back to the city. Once we arrived, we had a couple of hours before our final group dinner. Some of the group were finishing their tour here in Ho Chi Minh City, but six of us were continuing on to Cambodia. Those continuing on from our group were myself and my two companions, and a family of three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for those of us continuing onwards,  we had a new group meeting to attend, where we met our new guide and the new group. There were none others going on the trip, all of whom had been together on another tour through Vietnam, though they had skipped Nha Trang and flown from Da Nang directly to Ho Chi Minh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only had a short amount of time left before it was time to go for our final dinner with our old group. Tonight we would in style. We went to the top floor of the Palace Saigon Hotel, to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293925-d1770187-Reviews-Lemongrass-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html&quot;&gt;Lemongrass Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. Here we had our own private room, shelled out for overly expensive drinks, and rather tasty food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we celebrated our tour guide, who really made the trip special for us. John, the best talker of the group, gave a great speech, sprinkling some lighthearted flak throughout. Afterwards, one of the girls presented our guide with our tip that we’d organised for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We paid the bill and headed up to the rooftop, which had a stunning view of the burgeoning city, and we took pictures. Of each other and with our tour guide. We caught cabs back to the hotel, and went for one final drink at a nearby bar. We saw a lot of young men and women going upstairs, and reasoned that upstairs must be a karaoke or nightclub area. None of us went up to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon we had finished our drinks, and it was time to say goodbye. We shook hands,  embraced and kissed this we wouldn’t see again, and said “See you in the morning to the others continuing on to Cambodia with us. Unfortunately we weren’t due much rest, as we had yet another early morning ahead…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vietnam Trip - Day 14</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-14&quot;&gt;Day 14&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I not so much woke up, more opened my bleary eyes after a night of unrest. I’m not sure why this was the case, as I’d slept reasonably well in comparison in the last night train we’d been on. But alas, it was 4:30 in the morning, the train was showing down, and fairly soon it was time to wake up and smell the pungent aromas of Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all piled into the bus without speed or enthusiasm. We reached our hotel and checked into day rooms,  and thankfully this one was a step up from the place we stayed in Nha Trang. We rotated through showering and getting freshened up (day rooms were always shared with others from the group), and soon enough  (or not), the restaurant was open for breakfast. Breakfast was okay, though I can’t say much can be appreciated when you’re tired. Well, coffee can be, and I downed about 4 of them before heading back downstairs to face the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we had the option of going to the Cu Chi Tunnels, where the Viet Cong held out against the Americans for a long time during the war. This was an interesting experience, not only because of what we saw and what they accomplished, but also the propagandist spin that we received. It also sound rather pro-Cong, which was quite opposed to the viewpoint of our guide from My Son, Mr Van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we got there, we stopped at a local house. Here we learned how to make rice paper, and even got to try doing it ourselves. This is not traditionally a man’s job, but I gave it a go anyway, and discovered I wasn’t too bad at it. At this house was also a garden and a pig farm. We got to feed the pigs, which were particularly large, and also got to see the piglets although they really didn’t liked to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found quite fascinating was learning how a pineapple grows. I’ve always had the mistaken impression that a pineapple just grows on a tree, whereas the reality is that the pineapple is the single flower of its own low-growing plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire area around the house, for miles around, was a rubber plantation. The plantation is wholly owned by the government, and any attempt to steal sap could get you shot. It is okay however to collect the seeds and plant your own rubber tree, and this house had a couple of their own trees, so we were able to see how rubber tree sap is collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tunnels, we got to see a lot of the kinds of traps that the Viet Cong used during the war, and also got to crawl through some section of tunnel as well. Some took one look at the tunnel entrance and Noped the hell out of there. I gave it a go, and opted to attempt the full 100 metres. I was at the back,  and I think that if I’d had somebody come up behind me I might have experienced some amount of claustrophobia. Thankfully I didn’t get to test this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this traipse through the tunnels we were offered some tea and the cooked root of a plant called Cassava. You might better recognise this as tapioca, which is the name given to a particular form of extract from this plant. In Africa another name is given - Makihot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went made our way back to the city, and met our guide at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293925-d1122861-Reviews-Pho_2000-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html&quot;&gt;Pho 2000&lt;/a&gt;, where we would follow in the steps of Bill Clinton and have a lunch of Pho. I don’t have much to compare this to, but I think the Pho was pretty good. Street lunch we went back to the hotel to collect the few people who didn’t come to the tunnels, and headed out for a city tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293925-d311103-Reviews-War_Remnants_Museum-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html&quot;&gt;War Remnants Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which had a fair few military vehicles outside,  including tanks, and Chinook and an F-5A fighter jet. There was also a collection of the sort of bombs used throughout the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the museum was a different story. In the first floor were evidence of outage from citizens of all countries against the Americans war in Vietnam. I took my time to get around the exhibits, and so didn’t get up the the top floor, but I did get to the second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second floor, on one side were graphic images and stories,  either from survivors or from journalists who accompanied the American troops. Survivors were few, and according to the exhibits, all Vietnamese in all villages were treated as Viet Cong. Women and children were all killed, not just men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the second floor was an exhibition of images and statistics regarding the impact of Agent Orange and other harmful chemicals used throughout the war, most of which contained the very harmful Dioxin. In a way this was worse than all the outright murder of many people,  due to the ongoing effects of poisoning the land and the people. Dioxin not only affects those initially poisoned with it, but through severe genetic mutation also affects their offspring, and their offsprings offspring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this weighing down heavy, and even more distaste for the Americans, we headed onwards to our next destination - the reunification palace. We only looked in from outside the gate,  but you could see that it was built with some grandeur, and the style was still rather modern despite its age. We continued on a walkabout tour, visiting a catholic church with French inspiration in the architecture, then across the road to the old post office building, which was in fact still in use, and I finally found a fee-free ATM within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some rest and recuperation time at the hotel (and swapping into our night rooms), we headed out to dinner to a place that specialises in pancakes (Vietnamese pancakes are savoury). Aside from being fried, you could probably call these pancakes quite healthy, as they’re made with rice flour, water and egg, so also great for those who eat gluten free. In Vietnam,  you don’t just eat a fried spring roll or a pancake by itself, instead you roll it up into a lettuce or cabbage leaf before dipping into the dipping sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we were due for another early morning, so now if us were about to hit the bar. We all slunk off to bed to get as much sleep as we could.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vietnam Trip - Day 13</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-13&quot;&gt;Day 13&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sore head. Probably not as bad as it could have been, but I was definitely hungover. Thankfully, today was a free day, so I didn’t have to do too much. After taking a lot of rehydration salts and water, and after a greasy breakfast, I went out to run a few errands. This little ritual is reasonably similar to my usual hangover cure, whereas I would normally have a powerade and fish’n’chips (and of course a shower!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After collecting some bathroom supplies, I moved our bags across the hall to our the day room, as we would not be staying another night here. This room was already occupied by two of the Swiss girls, the other one having gone out for a day at the mud baths with my own travelling companions. They left shortly after to run their own errands. Since by this time I was rather hot and sweaty from being outside, I pulled up a chair and turned down the relatively ineffective air conditioning to chill out for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I still had some errands to run,  so I went out and got all that over and done with. Coming back to the hotel I found the girls had returned to the room. We all spent some time reading, but it easing long before all of us were napping - we’d all been out late the night before, after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up again, a plan was formed to go to the beach, but not before lunch was obtained. I cannot recommend it, but we had lunch at the Seafood and Western Food Restaurant. This would be the second time I’d eat some kind of Western food by choice while on this trip. I had a chicken burger, and all of our meals came out very slowly,  and one after the other. By the time the first person finished their meal, the next persons meal was just coming out. Plus the burger bun was rock hard, despite it not being gluten free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After paying the bill, we crossed the road to the beach. We paid to sit under a breach umbrella (40,000 doing per person, or roughly $2 each), and I watched the bags while the rest went for a swim. I could have spent this time catching up on writing, but instead I relaxed and read for a while in the shade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not long before the mud-bathers returned and joined us, but it was also being late. Another hour on the beach and it was time to get back to the hotel and get ready to go. Tonight we were getting on yet another train, once again an overnighter, to Ho Chi Minh City, aka Saigon. Knowing we weren’t going to get dinner on the train, we changed out of our beach clothes and into something more city-friendly and headed out to dinner. Since my partner hadn’t gone out for dinner the night we arrived, we took her back to that restaurant (Lanterns), since the food had been rather good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my dismay, my two travelling companions both ordered fish and chips! Unfortunately instead of trying something new I went for the Simmering Pork, which I knew to be good from last time. Even though we had told some people where we’d be, nobody joined us, and we heard later that they’d actually gotten a little lost trying to find us, which I think is forgivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a while to wait at the train station. The train was marginally late, which was just as well, as our tour guide’s clothes had still not come back from the laundry. While he went off to get his clothes, we were left a little confused each time we heard an announcement from the station, as none of it was in English. Was it our train arriving, or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully we all got onto the train alright, though not before a bit of confusion over which rooms would be occupied by whom. It was still early in the night, and our guide was still hungry after an unsatisfying dinner if his own, so a few of us joined him on an excursion to the restaurant carriage at the back of the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy am I glad I didn’t eat train food. The carriage was a little worse for wear, and the off-duty cooks were smoking inside. Our guide still ordered some food - I suppose it is pretty hard to mess up instant noodles. We were really only there to socialise, so we had the token beer or water while he ate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we had an estimated 4:30am departure time, we headed back for an early night’s sleep. Unfortunately sleep did not come easy, and it did not come well. I was restless, and knew this would not fair overly well for the next day…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vietnam Trip - Day 12</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-12&quot;&gt;Day 12&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nha Trang, to those who know it,  is a party beach city. This I can confirm. It is also full of Russians.  Through the war, Russia provided much support to the Vietnamese, and they rented a military base in the Nha Trang area. Now, there are many flights from Russia to Nha Trang, including direct flights from Moscow, making for quite a large population of Russians. So many in fact that unlike other parts of Vietnam where you’ll find a restaurant menu in Vietnamese and English, you’ll find some restaurants in Nha Trang that have menus primarily in Russian, and the staff might speak Russian instead of English (and of course always Vietnamese).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning of Day 12, we headed down to port,  optionally grabbed some flippers and jumped on a boat. It was a beautiful day, blue sky and plenty of sun, and in Nha Trang the water is safe to swim in! So on this day, this particular morning, we were going snorkelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed out to an island out in the bay. We wandered through the village,  getting some idea of island life as we went. On the other side of the island we got into another, smaller boat the shape of a bowl, one of the more traditional Vietnamese fishing boats. As we were loading in, we got to see one come in with a load of fish, which they proceeded to weigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These little boats were really just taking us back to our original boat,  which had moved around the island to meet us. The body took us out to a reef just off the shore of another island and anchored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all changed into our togs and jumped into the water. It was refreshingly cool,  and I was happy to finally be able to immerse myself in a decent amount of water for the first time in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a swim, the crew served us lunch, which included prawns, fish, noodles, rice and spring rolls. For food on a boat I was impressed - it probably beat some restaurant food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a few more hours out on the boat,  some time spent swimming and some spent sun bathing. With sufficient application of sunblock, I myself choose to sun bathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we returned to Nha Trang,  clouds were settling in. As we came into harbour, rain started to fall. It was quite nice really, a light, refreshing drizzle. It was about 3pm, so back at the hotel we had a few hours free time, which must of us used to shower and rest before dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say dinner was a token dinner,  having been fed fairly well for lunch and not exerting much energy. But we needed to have something in us - tonight we would experience some of the night life in Nha Trang. Being still quite early in the evening, most of us went to the first bar,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293928-d782081-Reviews-Why_Not_Bar-Nha_Trang_Khanh_Hoa_Province.html&quot;&gt;Why Not? Bar&lt;/a&gt;. You could say we are preloading,  though I was also trying to double down on the water as well. I ordered a drink called the “Why Not? Bucket”, and soon learned why it had this name. The drink came out in an plastic jar,  probably about one litre worth. Well, tonight could only end well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this bar we lost a few people to their beds, wishing to keep their heads. The rest of us that were left - you might call us youngsters - headed off to our intended final drinking hole, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293928-d1104316-Reviews-Sailing_Club_Nha_Trang-Nha_Trang_Khanh_Hoa_Province.html&quot;&gt;The Sailing Club&lt;/a&gt;. We got a free drink upon entry, although that’s debatable since there was a door charge. With the options of Heineken or a “Jam Jar”,  I kept my wits about me and went for the jam jar. Lo and behold, out came another vessel of the same form as the Why Not? Bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sailing Club also had a dance floor, which suited us just fine. Walking up past the asian analogues of the white man dance, I took my partner by the hand and we put a little show. It felt a little sloppy but we’ve been slack with practice and were dancing in sandals, but that didn’t stop people pulling out their cameras and phones. Given that we were dancing Modern Jive to techno, it wasn’t long before we had to take a break… Well maybe for her, but our flatmate demanded a dance so I didn’t get to rest until I was quite sweaty (given the heat, this wasn’t long).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sailing Club sits on prime real estate on the beach,  so we retired out there where we could feel some of the nice sea breeze. By this time I was just drinking water, but that didn’t stop me from playing leap frog, managing to leap over three people, all the while feeling reasonably certain that I would fall short and take one of the others out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more dance (for the others) and we headed back to the hotel, which was practically just around the corner. I started loading myself with rehydrating salts, in hopes of preventing some part of the massive hangover I was rather likely due.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vietnam Trip - Day 11</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-11&quot;&gt;Day 11&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine o’clock was our designated time of departure. We ate, packed and loaded into the bus. Our tailored clothes had arrived during the evening while at dinner. All ready to go, we piled into another bus and headed back up to Da Nang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got off at Da Nang station. As per usual, with the trains running on Vietnam time our train was late, so we were sitting around in the station for about an hour. I passed the time by looking through the attached souvenir and food store,  getting a few snacks for the day trip to Nha Trang. I also amused myself watching Looper bring played on one of the screens, on mute and with Vietnamese subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train was meant to take about 8 hours to get to Nha Trang. I think it ended up taking about 9 or 10. But that’s about standard, I’ve learnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Nha Trang,  we quickly got onto yet another bus, and rode off to our hotel. We arrived around about 9:30pm, but our tour guide still thought it’d be a good idea to have dinner. After checking in we headed out to a nearby restaurant called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293928-d1515355-Reviews-Lanterns_Vietnamese_Restaurant-Nha_Trang_Khanh_Hoa_Province.html&quot;&gt;Lanterns&lt;/a&gt;. The food there was pretty good (I had the Simmering Pork in a Clay Pot), though I think many of us ate far too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bed wasn’t far away, and after a day of not much, sleep was very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vietnam Trip - Day 10</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-10&quot;&gt;Day 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually got a chance to sleep in today! We only had to be ready to go by 8.30. After another nice breakfast at the villa we were off on our feet again, but not for long. About five minutes down the road we jumped into bicycles - the old school, single gear beachcomber style things,  which are apparently popular in the Hoi An area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rode off into town, but this was only a means to an end,  as fairly soon we were out in the slightly less busy countryside. Now, I say less busy but  we still had scooters passing us in all directions, including on roads you might be forgiven for mistaking as footpaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way we had a close up look and rice in the fields (I for one have never seen rice growing before), also how they grow and water lemongrass and other herbs,  which involved two buckets that they hung on either end of a stick, which went across their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the bike ride ended with a boat ride. My partner prides herself on what she calls “real-world tetris”, or effectively packing many things into a small space. She has nothing on the Vietnamese people. In this instance,  they packed about 16 bikes into a space  of about a square metre at the back of this boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going down the river we had some photo opportunities as we passed some fishermen casting out their nets, and various other river life. At the other end we unpacked or bikes. We were back in the old quarter of Hoi An,  and it was almost time for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all headed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298082-d1122024-Reviews-The_Cargo_Club-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt; , another restaurant owned by the same people as Morning Glory. Here we were to order lunch for the following day,  when we would be on a day train to Nha Trang. The group soon dispersed,  leaving just a few of us hungry enough to stay and try the food at Cargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lunch this time, we ate western food. I’ve got to say, the Vietnamese can make a damn good cheese burger - better than any I’ve had in Australia so far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being our last day in Hoi An, we left the restaurant with every intention of visiting some of the temples around the place. But first we had fittings to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clothes were practically finished at Yaly. Fit was great, especially the pants (or so I have been told). My travel partners,  having gotten some stuff from Blue Eyes as well, weren’t having so much luck. They would have to come back in another couple of hours. I paid for mine and was informed that it would be delivered to our accommodation, after going through quality assurance checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed back in the direction of our lodgings,  but stopped short. The girls decided that it was high-time for a massage,  and that I was in dire need of a pedicure. And a shave. In retrospect,  they were right… On the pedicure at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t lose all my beard,  all I needed was a trim to keep the shape and tidy everything up. The massage was very relaxing, though I could probably have gone for longer. The pedicure was probably the most necessary thing at the time - my toenails were getting longer than some girls fingernails, and to make matters worse I’d stubbed my big toe earlier in the trip,  which had bent the toenail back and torn it as well, to accommodate the bend. I also had my calluses removed from my feet -  now I’ve got to build them up again for dancing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way back the homestay, while the girls went back into town for their fittings. I whiled away the time before dinner by initially cooling off in the air conditioned bedroom, before going outside to enjoy the farmside view from the eating area of the villa. Others from the tour group slowly joined me and we had a chat over drinks until finally the girls got back from their fittings, just in time for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner this evening we would be eating local. Not with a family this time, but at a local restaurant. This is not one that would be easy to find just wandering around, as it was well off the beaten track. The good news was that it was full of Vietnamese - it had to be good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And good it was. In true Vietnamese fashion they served us 4-5 courses, which hit the spot. The only problem we had was that the fish and chicken dishes came with bones, so we had to be careful with those, but otherwise the flavours were amazing. It makes me wonder if the restaurants in town tone down the flavour of their dishes  for westerners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there it was a long walk home, and an early night for all. Our last night in Hoi An, making the most of the sleeping time available to us!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vietnam Trip - Day 9</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-9&quot;&gt;Day 9&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could be forgiven for thinking we knew it was the weekend - we didn’t. Especially not when you’re waking up so early as to have showered and feed yourself, all ready to go by 7:30, it to the My Son ruins about an hour or so out of Hoi An. We all piled into a bus and bid farewell to our tour guide for a couple of hours, as he handed us over to another tour guide specifically for this activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, this tour guide was a wealth of information - not just on the ruins, but having grown up in the area and lived through the “American War”, he had many stories to tell, and we were just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The My Son ruins, deep in the hills around Hoi An, are the ruins of what used to be a village of Cham people. The Cham people were Hindu, and thus there were many statues of the Hindu god Shiva around. The ruins here predate the temples in Ankor Wat (we’re going there too!), and have something extra interesting about them: There is no cement or mortar between the bricks, so the result is that the bricks are very close together, and in some cases are indistinguishable from one another. Apparently nobody had been able to discover what was used to stick the bricks together. Reparations being done to the ruins had used some water resistant tree sap to achieve a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps just as puzzling as the brick laying were the stone pillars - how did the Cham people move such large, heavy blocks of stone to their build site, let alone  erect them for use in for frames, as the lintel, etc?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disappointingly, over the years the ruins have been pillaged, with statues missing heads and arms, taken as prizes by thieves. But this is not the reason I call them ruins - most of these buildings were completely during the war, when the Vietcong took refuge there and American gunships laid siege. These ruins, and much more, lend a feeling of disgust towards Americans (if there wasn’t this feeling already).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to the hotel, our My Son guide told us all about his own story, living through the war, learning English and working as a translator for the American military, the re-education camps of the communist party, and then final steps until he became a tour guide. His English was excellent (although the Swiss girls may have had trouble understanding him), and I would recommend him to anybody. (Sorry, I can’t find a link to him, but have found a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mukavitz.wordpress.com/2013/06/30/indochine-part-viii-the-cham-ruins-and-mr-van/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; of someone else who has had the pleasure of meeting this man and going on this tour.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back at the hotel, I was starving. My partner was sick from the two bus rides, so I left her behind to nap and wandered back into the Old Quarter. On my wander I found a book shop, with a few books I was thinking of purchasing (especially given the prices). Wandering onwards, I saw the Swiss girls a few steps ahead on another road, and ran to catch up with them. With them feeling hungry as well (a couple of them didn’t have time for ballast before getting on the bus) we went for lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298082-d1487249-Reviews-Morning_Glory_Restaurant-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html&quot;&gt;Morning Glory&lt;/a&gt;, definitely one of the best places to eat in the Old Quarter. Four spring rolls and a bowl of Cau Lau noodles later and I was fairly well sated. I went with the girls to blue eyes where they had their first fit for their dresses (which were lovely, by the way), then joined one of them who was shopping for joke gifts for the other two (something like they do on Top Gear, but much smaller and gifted after their trip).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after I was walking home, intent on checking up on my sick partner. Not half a minute before I got there however did I receive a message from her, saying she and our flatmate were at Morning Glory, having a late lunch! About-turn, I head back into town, and find them outside a store looking a souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were due for our own first fits shortly, so we went into Yaly and found our sales people. As far as my own clothing went, I was fairly happy with the first cut, but a lot of work had yet to be done, and everything needed to be taken in. My compatriots had similar issues with fit, perhaps even worse. It’s quite something to stand around trying on clothes, having five different people looking at the clothes on you, with the occasional butt grab (unintentional, I’m sure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to the hotel, I bought a set of chopsticks that I liked the look of, from a road side stall. These particular chopsticks have a lovely green ornamental end, which may be jade but I’d say would be more likely to be green glass. Back at the hotel my partner was still not feeling well, secondly not well enough to eat, so we left her to sleep some more, and headed back into town for dinner. Tonight we were doing something a little different - a cooking class. We all meet up and had a drink at Lantern Town before venturing further out into Hoi An, where the chosen coming class was being held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrepid Travel, who we are traveling with, are all about responsible travel, and supporting good local businesses. For this reason we didn’t take one of the many cooking classes inside the Old Quarter, but to a local chef further out. This chef was very pleasant, had good English, and encouraged drinking while cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned how to cook crispy pancakes, fish in banana leaf, green papaya salad and fried vegetable spring rolls. To top it all off, after cooking this delicious meal, we finally got to eat it. As a gift to us, the chef gave us recipes for everything that we cooked, plus some cooking chopsticks. More chopsticks for the collection!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner we all called it a night, with some wanting to catch a taxi home. Unfortunately taxis were few and far between by this time, so we all ended up walking home together. My partner, I discovered, had slept the entire time, not even getting up to eat, so I tried not to disturb her too much as I got myself into bed, for a slightly longer night’s sleep than the last…&lt;/p&gt;
