<p>This is part 2 in a series of posts about a little electronics project I started at work. <a href="/2016/07/11/i-couldnt-do-that-could-i.html">You can find the first post here.</a></p>

<hr />

<p>As said in my previous post, I wanted to build a device to show financial goals or the company’s financial milestones. I wanted this to be visible from across the room, so it had to be big… what could I use that would fit the bill?</p>

<p><img src="/images/split_flap_display.jpg" alt="Split Flap Display" /></p>

<p>Have you ever seen those large old boards at some airports or other travel ports that make a whole lot of clacking noise? You know, the ones that physically turn over a set of cards until it gets to the right number? They’re called Split Flaps, and are (quite obviously) a mechanical device that can be electrically driven/controlled. Each character you want to display is split in half across two flaps, and a ring of flaps is flipped around until the desired character is displaying at the front. This can be driven by a stepper motor. Those would be sweet as to get running and have some numbers displayed on… If only they weren’t about $100 apiece for a single module! There are some resources online about how to build them, but I’m not about to endeavour on a journey to learn the intricacies and mechanics of a split-flap display when mechanics is probably my weakest area of expertise. Also, thinking about it now, that noise would have been SOOO obnoxious. Split-Flaps: Scratched.</p>

<p><img src="/images/alarm_clock.jpg" alt="Digital Alarm Clock" /></p>

<p>So my mind went to alarm clocks - digital alarm clocks specifically. I personally think that the seven-segment displays on alarm clocks give numbers much more tactility than just being put up on a monitor, and they’re relatively easy to find, so let’s follow this path some more!</p>

<p>Jaycar, a massive hobbyist/electronics chain here in Australia and NZ, stocks these displays in a few different sizes. I wanted this display to be seen from across the office, so naturally this meant big - how big can you get? Having a nosey around the Melbourne CBD Jaycar store, I grabbed a couple of 2.3” large displays, and a couple of driver ICs for them, all for the purposes of testing and determining if they were going to be the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>I spent almost a full day trying to figure out the pin-out of the displays I bought! It didn’t help that I was trying to use a 5V source, and after a bit of… “study” (RTFM/RTF Datasheet) I discovered that each of the main elements had 4 LEDs in series to light it up. In a bit of a hail-mary effort to try and get this thing to light up I pulled out a 9V battery and started feeding that in and once I found ground, hey presto, it works!</p>

<p><img src="/images/it_works.jpg" alt="It's working!" /></p>

<p>As it turns out, each of the main elements (segments) of the display used 4 LEDs in series (2 for the decimal point). Each of these LEDs was contributing a 1.8V voltage drop, summing up in series to 7.2V, which explains the failure of the 5V source to light anything up! During this period of discovery I think I also burnt out the dot on one of the displays, but that’s ok, it was all in the name of research!</p>

<p>I’d like to mention at this point that the “driver” IC is actually what’s called a “BCD decoder,” or “Binary-Coded Decimal decoder.” It takes 4 inputs A, B, C and D, each coresponding to the numbers 1, 2, 4 and 8. With any combination of these numbers you can make any decimal number, which the decoder decodes and sends out through it’s 7 outputs, each corresponding to a segment on the seven-segment display. Some BCD decoders have slightly different input schemes, such as A=1, B=2, C=2 and D=4, which prevents you from giving it input that it can’t display. The decoders I have just blank out the display when the number if is given doesn’t fit within the range of 0-9.</p>

<p>This idea seemed to have some legs, so I thought I’d move ahead with this and see how it plays out. I ignored all the problems that were surfacing in my head, such as power consumption, how I’d power it, how I’d control it, etc. Those were problems for another day!</p>
